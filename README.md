# Salesforce User-Owns-Data Embedding App

This sample project named
[**SalesforceUserOwnsDataApp**](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/SalesforceUserOwnsDataEmbedding/tree/main/SalesforceUserOwnsDataApp)
consists of a very simple Single Page Application (SPA) that implements
User-Owns-Data embedding with Power BI reports. The solution is built
using three essential files which include
[**index.html**](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/SalesforceUserOwnsDataEmbedding/blob/main/Dist/index.html),
[**app.css**](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/SalesforceUserOwnsDataEmbedding/blob/main/Dist/App/app.css)
and
[**app.js**](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/SalesforceUserOwnsDataEmbedding/blob/main/Dist/App/app.js).
This solution contains an option fourth file named **loading.gif** which
is used to demonstrate a white-label loading technique in which the
developer can display a custom loading image instead of the standard
Power BI branded loading image.

The **SalesforceUserOwnsDataApp** project uses three different
JavaScript libraries which include [jQuery](https://jquery.com/),
[Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript
v2](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-browser)
(**msal-browser.js**) and the [Power BI JavaScript
library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/overview/powerbi/)
(**powerbi.js**).

Once this SPA application has been deployed and configured, you can
integrated it into a Salesforce environment using iFrame tags. This
techniques makes it possible to embed Power BI report in VisualForce
pages, Lighting Applications and Lighting Aura components.

A central motivation for this project is to provide a User-Owns-Data
embedding experience in the Salesforce environment with more flexibility
than the out-of-the-box [Secure Embed
feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-embed-secure).
In particular, when embedding a Power BI report using an iFrame
generated for the Secure Embed feature, the user must click the Sign-in
button each time they begin a new browser session.

This continual requirement for user interaction to load a Power BI
report has the potential to make our end users a bit cranky. A embedding
solution using **SalesforceUserOwnsDataApp** provides the following
advantages over implementing User-Owns-Data embedding using the Secure
Embed feature.

-   When users log in the first time, their credentials are cached in
    the browser using refresh tokens.

-   Once user credentials are cached, embed reports will automatically
    load without requiring interaction.

-   This app uses a white-labelling technique to hide the Power BI logo
    which is exchanged for an animated GIF with a custom loading image.

## Setting Up the **SalesforceUserOwnsDataApp** Sample

To configure the **SalesforceUserOwnsDataApp** sample, you must follow
these steps.

-   Find a place to publish the application files where they're
    accessible through HTTPS.

-   Create an Azure AD application for a Single Page Application

-   Download the [application
    files](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/SalesforceUserOwnsDataEmbedding/archive/main.zip)
    and configure **app.js** to use your application ID and tenant.

-   Upload the application files to the publish location where they're
    accessible through an HTTPS URL.

-   Update the Azure AD application with the URL for the domain where
    you published application files.

-   Test embedding a Power BI report by going directly to the
    application's URL.

-   Embed the report in Salesforce by adding iFrames to a VisualForce
    page.

## Find a location to publish the application files

There are many different places you can publish the application files
where they are accessible through a URL that uses the HTTPS protocol.
For example, let's say you create a new Azure App Service which has a
base URL of **https://salesforceuserownsdataapp.azurewebsites.net**.
Once you upload the application files to this location, the
**index.html** file should then be accessible through the following URL.

## Creating an Azure AD application for an SPA

The setup process includes creating a new Azure AD application in the
same tenant which contains the Power BI reports you'd like to embed.
Begin by navigating to the [App
registration](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps)
page in the Azure portal and click the **New registration** link.

<img src="ReadMe\media\image5.png" style="width:3.98585in;height:1.34883in" />

On the **Register an application** page, enter an application name such
as **Salesforce User-OwnsData Embedding App** and accept the default
selection for **Supported account types** to restrict users to a single
tenant.

<img src="ReadMe\media\image6.png" style="width:5.3723in;height:2.43396in" />

In the **Redirect URL (optional)** section, select **Single Page
Application (SPA)** from the dropdown list on the left and enter the
base URL where you will publish your application files followed by the
HTML page name of **index.html** as shown in the following screenshot.
Next, click the Register button to create the new Azure AD application.

<img src="ReadMe\media\image7.png" style="width:6.7131in;height:1.91509in" />

When you create the new Azure AD application, the Azure portal should
navigate to the application overview page which displays the
**Application ID**. You will need to copy this Application ID and paste
it into **app.js**. At this point, copy the Application ID and paste it
into a new Notepad document so you can paste it into **app.js** later.

<img src="ReadMe\media\image8.png" style="width:4.85377in;height:1.98093in" />

An Azure AD application can optionally be configured with multiple
**Redirect URIs**. In some scenarios you might want to add additional
**Redirect URIs** which can be accomplished by click the
**Authentication** link in the left navigation and then clicking **Add
URI**. For example, you can add a second Redirect URI of
**https://localhost:44300** so that you can run and test the
**SalesforceUserOwnsDataApp** sample project in Visual Studio 2019.

<img src="ReadMe\media\image9.png" style="width:4.17965in;height:1.98585in" />

Now that you have created the Azure AD application, it's time to modify
**app.js** with the Application ID and the Tenant Name. If you open
app.js, you will see two variables named **clientId** and **tenant**.
Update the **clientId** variable with the Application ID of the new
Azure AD application. Update the **tenant** variable with the name of
your Azure AD tenant.

<img src="ReadMe\media\image10.png" style="width:4.56132in;height:1.97657in" />

Once you have made these changes to **app.js**, upload all four
application files to the publishing location. At this point, you should
be able to access the index.html file through the HTTPS protocol.

<img src="ReadMe\media\image11.png" style="width:4.19811in;height:1.09815in" />

Now you are ready to test the application. But first you to find the
report ID of the report you want to embed. In a separate browser tab,
open a Power BI report and copy the Report ID from the URL in the
browser address bar.

<img src="ReadMe\media\image12.png" style="width:5.22642in;height:1.626in" />

Now return to the application page and add a query string parameter
named **reportId** with the value set to the report Id. After
configuring the reportId query string parameter, resubmit the page.

<img src="ReadMe\media\image13.png" style="width:5in;height:0.57222in" />

When you refresh the page with the **reportId** parameter, the
application should begin the login sequence. After logging in the first
time, each user should be prompted with a standard Azure AD dialog which
prompts the user to accept the permissions requested by the application.
Click the **Accept** button to continue.

<img src="ReadMe\media\image14.png" style="width:3.03577in;height:2.01509in" />

At this point, the report should be displayed in the browser. The
application has now been set up and configured and you can begin using
it in Salesforce.

<img src="ReadMe\media\image15.png" style="width:4.41189in;height:2.41429in" />

Now it's time to embed things in a Salesforce page. For example, you can
create an VisualForce page with the following code to embed a report.

```html
<apex:page showHeader="true" standardStylesheets="false"  >

  <h1>Custom Embed 2</h1>
  
  <iframe 
    width="1200" 
    height="720" 
    src="https://salesforceuserownsdataapp.azurewebsites.net/index.html?reportId=YOUR_REPORT_ID" 
    frameborder="0" 
    allowFullScreen="true">
  </iframe>

</apex:page>
````
This should result in a Salesforce page that embed a Power BI report.

<img src="ReadMe\media\image16.png" style="width:6.23926in;height:3.07076in" />
