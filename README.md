Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point. When you

To make your document look professionally produced, Word provides

Themes and styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you
click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt
graphics change to match your new theme. When you apply styles, your
headings change to match the new theme.

Save time in Word with new buttons that show up where you need them. To
change the way a picture fits in your document, click it and a button
for layout options appears next to it. When you work on a table, click
where you want to add a row or a column, and then click the plus sign.

Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading view. You can collapse parts
of the document and focus on the text you want. If you need to stop
reading before you reach the end, Word remembers where you left off -
even on another device.
